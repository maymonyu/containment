Steps:

On the first timestamp only the first robot should start moving.

A robot can start moving only if it has message waiting in its buffer.


Start moving:
* Calculate the steer
* Set speed to be 1 (to start the movement)

On moving:
* Check if the robot's FOV is touching one of its neighbours FOVs
* If so, STOP MOVING
* Otherwise keep going

Stop moving:
* Set speed to 0
* Send "move" message to the next robot
