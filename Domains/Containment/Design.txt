Target:
Implement the even-odd algorithm.

# Change the initial locations of the robots
    - Define x (for now, define it to be half the radius)
    - Define r(x)
    - Set edge index for each robot


# Define the algorithm
    - Set steer be vertical to the line
    - Divide the algorithm by the edge index
