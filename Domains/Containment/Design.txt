Choose algorithm:
    Setting: 100 locust in random location
        Define number of robots:
            Define the velocity of the locust:
                Output: csv file with 20-30 lines:
                    each line is running output: Time reaching to MEP, Dead locust, Alive locust


1. Add 3-for loop in SimulationCanvas:
    a. first loop - run over the locust locations (e.g the settings)
    b. second loop - run over the number of robots (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
    c. third loop - run over the locust's velocity


- Set 10 Settings manually - only locust locations - DONE

- Create dsc including the number of robots and the locust locations - DONE
    - Read locust locations from numbered file
    - Call GenerateLocust from AutoDscGenerator with the locations and velocity
    - Call GenerateRobots from AutoDscGenerator with the number of robots
    - Generate .dsc file

- Set locust's velocity - DONE
    - MAX_TRANSLATION is the velocity
    - Add the velocity to dsc file
    - attractorSim will get it, and SquiggleBallSim will get it from AttractorSim
- Understand how to run simulation, stop it, and run it again - DONE
- Run simulation and stop when all robots are near their destination point - DONE

- Write results to file - DONE

- Uniform distribution of initial locations - DONE
- Add both algorithms - DONE
