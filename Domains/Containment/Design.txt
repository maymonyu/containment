Target:
Give an algorithm which keeps a close area & reduce the area to 0-size.

The algorithm:
Each edge goes in the way of the center of the angle (of the edge and the previous edge),
until the robot reaches the end of others polygon's FOV.

Tasks:
1. Set the direction of each robot at 0-time.
    If the robot is on the same line of his neighbour, take the direction if the neighbour,
    otherwise calculate direction.

2. Find the robots in which you have collision with, and go till you reach the end of the collision.
