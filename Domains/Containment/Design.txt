Target:
Give an algorithm which keeps a close area & reduce the area to 0-size.

The algorithm:
Each edge goes in the way of the center of the angle (of the edge and the previous edge),
until the robot reaches the end of others polygon's FOV.

Rudundant:

Define redundant:
A redundant robot is a robot which isn't contributing to the closure of the area.

Recognize redundant:
When the neighbours of a robot collide, the robot become redundant.

Check Redundancy:
Check if the neighbours collide, if so:
    - Tell them that they collide
    - Define itself as redundant
    - If redundant already - stay still
